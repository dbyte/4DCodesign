1. Install Sphinx (this should be a one-time operation per environment):
   cd into 4DCodesign/codesign
   run command: pip install -r requirements.txt
2. cd into 4DCodesign/docs
3. run command: make clean && make html
4. If doc build succeeded: Open "4DCodesign/docs/build/html/index.html" to see the result
